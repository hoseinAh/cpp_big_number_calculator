# cpp_big_number_calculator
hi, this project was my first real coding (:
the purpose was to create a simple calculator which can handle big numbers like 2^800000
The operators are add,minus,multiply,power,divide(cpp style 2/5 or 2/5.0),remainder & square root.
the program gets the input from ".in" file (the name is given by user) and put the answer in ".out" file ,
  The input file contains mathematical sentences in every row, two numbers and one operator.  2 + 2 =
The input proccening sucks :) , just give in the correct form. it can't completely detect the syntax errors or math errors .etc.
every number is stored in a "number" structure, 8-digits by 8-digits , it reduce memory access.
